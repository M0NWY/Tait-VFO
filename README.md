# Tait-VFO
An arduino uno based system to set the frequency of a tait-555 uhf radio.

The tait 555 is quite a nice UHF FM radio trancever incumbered by the fact that it is programmed by a diode matrix which is very restrictive.

The old-school solution to this was to use EEPROM's and thumb wheels to give 100 channels.

The following device and software allows the entire amature 70cm band and beyond to be tuned to in 12.5khz steps.

I've also included provision for repeater shifts.


TODO: some sort of last channel and quick jump memory... this may require more buttons !!
